# Predicting-House-Prices-Using-Random-Forest

# Introduction
In the dynamic landscape of real estate, accurately predicting house prices holds immense importance for various stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques offers a promising approach to tackle this challenge effectively. This report details the process of constructing a predictive model using a Random Forest Regressor, a robust algorithm renowned for its versatility and predictive power. Our focus lies on utilizing a synthetic dataset encompassing key features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the age of the house to forecast the price.

# Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the age of the house. By leveraging the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, the goal is to analyze and understand the key factors influencing house prices and to provide reliable price predictions that can assist buyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers in making informed decisions in the real estate market.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains 100 observations with the following features:

SquareFeet: The total area of the house in square feet.
Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms.
Bathrooms: The number of bathrooms.
Age: The age of the house in years.
Price: The price of the house in dollars (target variable).
